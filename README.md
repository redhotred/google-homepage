Hello! This is my first repo on github with the help of The Odin Project!
This is a rough copy of the Google homepage.
Comment pointers on how I should improve it.
Thanks guys!

What I learned while making this mini-project:

    - I need to get more familliar in writing code from scratch. I used a good 3 hours searching for codes I need to use to implement my ideas

    - I need to focus in improving my CSS skills since there are a lot of solutions to a problem. I think HTML is also like this but you I think HTML is more straightforward.

    - Interpreting what you see in inspect element is a skill

    - Nothing beats the satisfaction of seeing your work transform as you code. Finishing the project is bliss.

* I skipped reading much of the instructions which made this project take longer than it should've been. I should've made the header and foorter navbars as unordered lists.
*I appreciate comments on how I can make my code cleaner and more efficient. Thank you!
